  abstract = {Selecting the ``right'' amount of information to include in a summary is a difficult task. A good summary should be detailed and entity-centric without being overly dense and hard to follow. To better understand this tradeoff, we solicit increasingly dense GPT-4 summaries with what we refer to as a ``Chain of Density'' (CoD) prompt. Specifically, GPT-4 generates an initial entity-sparse summary before iteratively incorporating missing salient entities without increasing the length. Summaries generated by CoD are more abstractive, exhibit more fusion, and have less of a lead bias than GPT-4 summaries generated by a vanilla prompt. We conduct a human preference study on 100 CNN DailyMail articles and find that that humans prefer GPT-4 summaries that are more dense than those generated by a vanilla prompt and almost as dense as human written summaries. Qualitative analysis supports the notion that there exists a tradeoff between informativeness and readability. 500 annotated CoD summaries, as well as an extra 5,000 unannotated summaries, are freely available on HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/griffin/chain\_of\_density).},

After establishing a theoretical framework based on a functional approach to comparative politics, the authors apply their scheme to Southeast Asia (Lucian W. Pye), South Asia (Myron Weiner), SubSaharan Africa (James S. Coleman), the Near East (Dankwart Rustow), and Latin America (George I. Blanksten). In each area they survey the political background, the nature and function of political, governmental, and authoritative structures, the processes of change and means of political integration. The contributors have performed an extraordinarily difficult feat of classification, description, synthesis, and analysis in what promises to be a book of seminal importance in comparative politics.

In the dataset, we make yearly observations for all countries that have been independent at any point in time since the Second World War. Regarding democracies, we first distinguish between republics and monarchies. We then split the category of republics into presidential, semi-presidential, and parliamentary systems. Within the category of monarchies, almost all systems are parliamentary, but a few countries are conferred to the category semi-monarchies. Authors differ markedly in terms of how autocratic regimes should be classified. In the present dataset, we classify autocratic countries into the following main categories: absolute monarchy, military rule, party-based rule, personalist rule, and oligarchy. Within the categories party-based rule and oligarchy, we also identify a number of subcategories.},

But while LMs promise to replace conventional approaches to our efforts, there has been almost no systematic research into the reproducibility of research using these methods. This is a problem: the status quo for their use lacks the scientific integrity we expect in our field. We give a new theoretical framework for replication in the discipline and show that much LM work is uniquely wanting. We then demonstrate the problem empirically using a rolling iterated replication design in which we compare crowdsourcing and LMs on repeated, multiple tasks, over a long period of time (six months). We find that while LMs can match or exceed the accuracy of crowdworkers, the observed variance in LM performance is unexpectedly and unacceptably high. Indeed, in many cases the LM findings cannot be re-run, let alone replicated. We conclude with preliminary recommendations for best practice.},

Covering 1800–2007 and 213 countries, it represents the most comprehensive dichotomous measure of democracy currently available. We argue that our measure’s distinguishing features—a concrete, dichotomous coding and a long time span—are of critical value to empirical work on democracy. Inspired by Robert Dahl, we define a country as democratic if it satisfies conditions for both contestation and participation. Specifically, democracies feature political leaders chosen through free and fair elections and satisfy a threshold value of suffrage. After comparing our coding to that of other popular measures, we illustrate how democracy’s predictive factors have evolved since 1800. In particular, we show that economic modernization variables have steadily declined in their correlation with democracy over time.},

Yet cumulative development of this research is hampered by the controversial aspects and limitations of the existing indices of political democracy. These issues concern the validity of the indicators, the unknown reliability, and the limited sample and temporal coverage of these indices. After a discussion of these issues, a revised index of political democracy that overcomes some of these limitations is presented. The indicators of the revised index are analyzed by means of confirmatory factor analysis and the reliability of the measure is discussed. The index is generally better than existing measures in reliability, sample size, and temporal coverage; but the remaining limitations of the index are reviewed. The moderate to high correlations of this index with other democracy indices support its external validity. Yet, the differences in empirical results possible by using different indices are demonstrated. Finally, there are two appendices. The first provides the technical details of the confirmatory factor analysis. The second appendix lists the values of the political democracy index.},

Four problems of measurement are: invalid indicators, subjective indicators, ordinal or dichotomous measures, and the failure to test reliability or validity. The paper offers several suggestions to improve measurement as well as a warning about the danger of repeating past errors.},

The authors present an evidence-based portrait of key features of the authoritarian landscape with newly collected data about 200 dictatorial regimes. They examine the central political processes that shape the policy choices of dictatorships and how they compel reaction from policy makers in the rest of the world. Importantly, this book explains how some dictators concentrate great power in their own hands at the expense of other members of the dictatorial elite. Dictators who can monopolize decision making in their countries cause much of the erratic, warlike behavior that disturbs the rest of the world. By providing a picture of the central processes common to dictatorships, this book puts the experience of specific countries in perspective, leading to an informed understanding of events and the likely outcome of foreign responses to autocracies.},

One of four distinct but related datasets developed by Robert Gurr and his associates at Princeton University and Northwestern University to test hypotheses about the causes of conflict within contemporary nations and the correlates of institutional change, this study probes why some political institutions perform well and persist in response to challenges and crises while others change abruptly. Operational conceptualization of the study is provided with the description of salient characteristics of political systems in terms of the dimensions of authority patterns. Included are indicators of dimensions of authority, such as the openness of recruitment, decision constraints, participation, directiveness, and complexity, the degree to which each polity was autocratic, democratic, and anocratic, and the dichotomous indicator of coherence of a polity as consistently democratic. Additional data provide information on the circumstances of the birth and death of a polity, including the character of the polity and reasons for its termination. Three related studies focus on civil conflicts in polities: CONFLICT AND SOCIETY (ICPSR 7452), CIVIL STRIFE EVENTS, 1955-1970 (ICPSR 7531), and CIVIL STRIFE CONFLICT MAGNITUDES, 1955-1970 (ICPSR 7485).},

Our results demonstrate that different types of authoritarian regime face different propensities to develop toward democracy. Hence the nature of the authoritarian regime in question deserves to be added to the list of democracy's essential preconditions. One regime type—the limited multiparty system—stands out as the prime stepping stone to democracy. The fact that this regime type has become the most common form of authoritarianism can be seen as a promising sign for the future.},

Set up as a regression problem with weak supervision logic, the model is trained for the task of classification of segments of text for being/not being associated with authoritarian discourse. Rather than trying to define what an authoritarian discourse is, the model builds on the assumption that authoritarian leaders inherently define it. In other words, authoritarian leaders talk like authoritarians. When combined with the discourse defined by democratic leaders, the model learns the instances that are more often associated with authoritarians on the one hand and democrats on the other. The paper discusses several evaluation tests using the model and advocates for its usefulness in a broad range of research problems. It presents a new methodology for studying latent political concepts and positions as an alternative to more traditional research strategies.},

  abstract = {This study combines an examination of the relationship between levels of socioeconomic development and variation in political democracy in nation-states, with an evaluation of certain causal modeling techniques currently being employed in quantitative political analysis. The most important questions explored concern (1) the problems of defining and measuring political democracy on a cross-national basis; (2) the selection of statistical measures of association best fitted to support broad generalizations about the process of democratic political development; and (3) the causal modeling techniques most adequate to the tasks of inferring and testing causal propositions about this and other complex social processes.},

  abstract = {Historical data on the measures of democracy are needed for various purposes. Researchers testing hypotheses on democratic peace or domestic civil peace need such data (for example, Ray 1995; Hegre et al. 1997). The same concerns researchers exploring the relationship between democracy and economic development, or seeking causal explanations of democracy and democratization (Hadenius 1992; Karvonen 1997; Midlarsky 1997, Vanhanen 1997). Researchers have formulated various ways to measure democracy, or some aspects of democracy, since the 1950s, but it has been difficult to agree on the measures of democracy and democratization. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new dataset on the measurement of democracy and to compare it with some alternative dataseis. The Freedom House ratings of political rights and civil liberties since 1973 and the Polity project’s democracy and autocracy scales over the period 1800–1998 provide the most interesting points of comparison. The dataset introduced in this paper covers nearly all independent countries during the period 1810–1998.1},

  abstract = {Democracy has been defined and measured in various ways. This article argues that combining two basic dimensions of democracy - competition and participation - can yield a theoretically satisfactory measurement of democracy that employs three measures: degree of electoral competition, degree of electoral participation and a combined index of democratization. These variables have been used in the author's previous comparative studies of democracy. The new dataset combines previous data and extends these to cover the period 1810-1998. That dataset includes 187 contemporary and former independent states from the year 1810 or from the year of independence. In the dataset, original electoral and other political data needed to calculate the values of Competition and Participation variables are given and documented separately for each country. The values of the three variables are calculated and given for each year over the period of comparison. Finally, the new dataset is compared with the Polity98 measures of democracy and the combined Freedom House ratings of political rights and civil liberties.},

  abstract = {Research on autocratic regimes in comparative politics and international relations often uses categorical typologies of autocratic regimes to distinguish among different forms of autocracy. This paper introduces historical data on dozens of features of dictatorships to estimate latent dimensions of autocratic rule. We identify three time-varying dimensions of autocracy that correspond to ideal types proposed in the literature: party dominance, military rule, and personalism. We show that dimensions of autocratic rule are orthogonal to commonly-used measures of democracy–autocracy, and compare these dimensions to existing typologies of autocracies, showing that time-varying information on personalism is unique. We discuss a measurement model of personalism and illustrate the time-varying features of this measure in applied research on conflict initiation and regime collapse.},
