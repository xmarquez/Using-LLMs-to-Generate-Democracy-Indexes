  abstract = {Excitement about Language Models (LMs) abounds: these generative tools require minimal researcher input and yet make it possible to annotate and generate large quantities of data. But while LMs promise to replace conventional approaches to our efforts, there has been almost no systematic research into the reproducibility of research using these methods. This is a problem: the status quo for their use lacks the scientific integrity we expect in our field. We give a new theoretical framework for replication in the discipline and show that much LM work is uniquely wanting. We then demonstrate the problem empirically using a rolling iterated replication design in which we compare crowdsourcing and LMs on repeated, multiple tasks, over a long period of time (six months). We find that while LMs can match or exceed the accuracy of crowdworkers, the observed variance in LM performance is unexpectedly and unacceptably high. Indeed, in many cases the LM findings cannot be re-run, let alone replicated. We conclude with preliminary recommendations for best practice.},

We argue that differences across regime measures must be taken seriously and that they should be evaluated in terms of whether they (1) serve to address important research questions, (2) can be interpreted meaningfully, and (3) are reproducible. We argue that existing measures of democracy are not interchangeable and that the choice of measure should be guided by its theoretical and empirical underpinnings. We show that the choice of regime measure matters by replicating studies published in leading journals.},

The authors present an evidence-based portrait of key features of the authoritarian landscape with newly collected data about 200 dictatorial regimes. They examine the central political processes that shape the policy choices of dictatorships and how they compel reaction from policy makers in the rest of the world. Importantly, this book explains how some dictators concentrate great power in their own hands at the expense of other members of the dictatorial elite. Dictators who can monopolize decision making in their countries cause much of the erratic, warlike behavior that disturbs the rest of the world. By providing a picture of the central processes common to dictatorships, this book puts the experience of specific countries in perspective, leading to an informed understanding of events and the likely outcome of foreign responses to autocracies.},

Our results demonstrate that different types of authoritarian regime face different propensities to develop toward democracy. Hence the nature of the authoritarian regime in question deserves to be added to the list of democracy's essential preconditions. One regime type—the limited multiparty system—stands out as the prime stepping stone to democracy. The fact that this regime type has become the most common form of authoritarianism can be seen as a promising sign for the future.},

  abstract = {Research on autocratic regimes in comparative politics and international relations often uses categorical typologies of autocratic regimes to distinguish among different forms of autocracy. This paper introduces historical data on dozens of features of dictatorships to estimate latent dimensions of autocratic rule. We identify three time-varying dimensions of autocracy that correspond to ideal types proposed in the literature: party dominance, military rule, and personalism. We show that dimensions of autocratic rule are orthogonal to commonly-used measures of democracy–autocracy, and compare these dimensions to existing typologies of autocracies, showing that time-varying information on personalism is unique. We discuss a measurement model of personalism and illustrate the time-varying features of this measure in applied research on conflict initiation and regime collapse.},
